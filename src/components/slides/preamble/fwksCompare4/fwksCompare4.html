</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		A <em>React</em> application is a set of libraries provided
		by the community that the developer has to choose and assemble
		in order to get all functionalities he needs: More flexible but more
		work and less stable (be sure that your libraries will be maintain, readapt
		best practices for a new project...)
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Angular2</em> core library contains everything needed to make a complete application
		work
	</li>
	<li>
		<em>Angular2</em> provides an <em>Inversion Of Control</em> pattern (or Dependency Injection)
		associated with specific components such as <em>Pipes</em>, <em>Services</em> (...) for a great
		separation of concerns
	</li>
