	Typescript - Why to use it
</h2>

<p>
    <em>Typescript</em> is an open source <em>Microsoft</em> project.
    It allows to add typings constraints upon the javascript
    syntax. Again, <em>typescript</em> is not mandatory, you can
    write in pure <em>ES6</em> js as well if you want. But here
    are a few reasons we recommend it:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        For big projects, typed langages will help as well as for developer tools
        or for making complex Conception Oriented Object models 
     </li>
     <li>
         More specifically, for <em>Angular2</em> apps, it will be particularly interesting
         for DI mechanism which will be naturally based on types to automatically inject the
         needed data at some point... 
     </li>
     <li>
         <em>Angular2</em> itself is based on <em>typescript</em>
         so you will have access to all types definitions 
     </li>
     <li>
         Learning <em>typescript</em> is not much more than learning <em>ES6</em>
     </li>
</ul>
