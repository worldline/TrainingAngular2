	About Typescript - Is it required?
</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Short answer: No</li>
	<li> <em>Typescript</em> is not specific to <em>Angular</em>
	<li> the <em>typescript</em> code is just transpiled in javascript (from ES3 to ES6)</li>
	<li> So you can use javascript to develop you <em>Angular2</em> applications as well </li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>But: typescript is used to develop the <em>Angular2</em> framework </li>
	<li> It has even been developed in conjunction with <em>Angular2</em></li>
	<li>It is a typed language</li>
	<li>Which is close to recent <em>JavaScript</em> syntax</li>
	<li>Which allows OOP</li>
	<li>Which allows to easily integrate recents best practices such as js modules loading</li>
	<li>And is interesting as soon as a project is big enough</li>
</ul>
