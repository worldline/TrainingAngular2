	Unit Tests - Jasmine and typescript... and karma... and Angular!
</h2>


<ul>
  <li>
    We are now able to execute unit tests written in typescript
    with jasmine in our browser
  </li>
  <li>
    But we need more, we need to specifically test <em>Angular2</em>
    objects
  </li>
  <li>
    For example, how to retrieve a service? A pipe?
    How to override a value to use mocks during DI?
  </li>
  <li>
    And how to automatize these tests?
    <em>Karma</em> will help us for that!
  </li>

</ul>
