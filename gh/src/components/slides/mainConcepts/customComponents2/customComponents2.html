</h2>

<ul>

	<li>
		Our <em>Components</em>/<em>Directives</em>
		are parameterizables through the <em>Property Binding</em>
		mechanism, which is a <em>top to down</em> communication
		<ul>
			<li>
				The properties bindings can be
				declared through the <em>inputs</em> attribute
			</li>
			<li>
				Or with the <em>@Input()</em> annotation
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>
		With the help of events, you can communicate from a child component
		to a parent one, which is a <em>down to top</em> communication
		<ul>
			<li>
				the event to throw can be declare with the <em>output</em> attribute
			</li>
			<li>
				Or with the <em>@Output()</em> annotation
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>
		Our <em>Components</em>/<em>Directives</em> could depend
		on services, and we could want specific providers for them
		<ul>
			<li>It's what the <em>providers</em> attribute is for</li>
			<li>Remember that it's available bot at the <em>@Component</em> level and at the <em>@NgModule</em> level</li>
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>
		We have access to custom methods to make specific treatments at some points
	</li>

</ul>
