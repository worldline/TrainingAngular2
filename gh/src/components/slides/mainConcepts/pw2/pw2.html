	Practical Work - Services &amp; Dependency Injection
</h2>

<p>
	You will create a simple service and inject it
	into a component
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		To do so, create and declare the service <em>ContactService</em>.
		The service has to contain informations which are actually hardly coded in the component:
		<em>email</em>, <em>phone</em>, <em>address</em>
	</li>
	<li>
		Inject the service into your component and use its field to initialize your component fields
	</li>
	<li>
		If you declared your service into the <em>providers</em> of a component, check that it also
		work if you declare it on the <em>bootstrap</em> method, and vice versa
	</li>
</ul>


<p class="exercise">
	The service we are creating is very simple, in a real world, it would at less retrieve these
	informations from the server and call an API to post the message, and so on. The idea here
	is just to let declare your own service and inject it into your component.
