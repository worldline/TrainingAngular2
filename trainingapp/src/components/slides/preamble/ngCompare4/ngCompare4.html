	Angular VS AngularJS, what remains? 
	How to upgrade?
</h2>

<p>
	To port from <em>Angular</em> to <em>AngularJS</em>, nothing magic, 3 important things:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Prepare the existing application! Which means follow best practices, 
		make it use recent technologies such as <em>typescript/ES6</em>, 
		and use the <em>Angular</em> router ported to <em>AngularJS</em>
	</li>
	<li>
		Use AngularJS directives, which will ease the process of converting 
		<em>AngularJS</em> directives to <em>Angular</em> components</li>
	<li>
		Include <em>Angular</em> in your <em>AngularJS</em> application, 
		to make them coexist together and convert things incrementally (more for developments, not sure using two frameworks at the same time in production is a good idea)
	</li>
